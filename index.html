          This Affinity Diagram is breaking down our Problem Statement  "Students may arrive at the food court for lunch only to find that the lines are too long for them to get lunch before their next class."
We have the subcatagories technology, user experience, administrative changes, and business. Under technology, we have features of the application that would need to be developed. Under user experience, we have methods that we can develop to help the user. Under business, we have future developments that can be made in order to move into different fields. Under administrative changes we have problems that may come up in the future.

          Gerald found a place where he enjoys the food; however, the place is new at not very known. Writing a full review and publishing it would take a long time, but he wants to share the information quicky. Publishing his reveiw on his social media would be quick, but he is not sure if his post will reach the people local to this area. If only there was a way to quickly publish credible reviews that would be broadcasted to the local people.
