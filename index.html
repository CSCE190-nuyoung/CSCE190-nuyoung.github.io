          This Affinity Diagram is breaking down our Problem Statement  "Students may arrive at the food court for lunch only to find that the lines are too long for them to get lunch before their next class."
We have the subcatagories technology, user experience, administrative changes, and business. Under technology, we have features of the application that would need to be developed. Under user experience, we have methods that we can develop to help the user. Under business, we have future developments that can be made in order to move into different fields. Under administrative changes we have problems that may come up in the future.
